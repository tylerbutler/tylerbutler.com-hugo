[1Up.com][1] is running a story called [The Essential 50][2], which lists what
they consider to be the 50 most essential video games. It's an interesting
history lesson, since every entry has a short history of the game, the
innovations it had, and the impact it had on the industry and video game
development. Interestingly, several games' major impact was not technology or
innovation, as I would have imagined, but rather political and/or social.
Interesting stuff.
