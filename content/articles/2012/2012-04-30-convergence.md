Love this quote from [Tim Cook](http://www.macstories.net/news/apple-q2-2012-results-39-2-billion-revenue-35-1-million-iphones-11-8-million-ipads-sold/):

> Anything can be forced to converge, but the problem is about trade-offs, and you end up with trade-offs that don't please anyone. You can converge a toaster and refrigerator, but the end result won't be pleasing to the user.
