Thanksgiving is a bit of a non-holiday to me. The problem is that it comes to
close to Christmas. Heck, I started hearing Christmas music in the grocery
store the week before Thanksgiving. What's up with that? Anyway, this makes
the third year that I haven't done anything for the holiday. I got invited a
few places this year, but frankly, I wasn't in the mood. I felt like I needed
some serious alone time (which is weird, because I am alone most of the time
anyway), and I have definitely gotten it this weekend. But I realized that a
lot of the posts -- heck, all of the posts -- I've made today have been pretty
negative, so I guess it's time to be positive and post some of the things I am
thankful for. This is a Thanksgiving tradition, I guess, but I was reminded to
do it after I read [Kristin's post about it][1] on [her and her husband's
blog][2]. Thanks for the reminder Kristin. (I also read about her [baking
peanut butter cookies][3] for Marco. Lucky guy, that Marco.) Anyway, here
goes:

  * **Friends**: The transition to living in Puget Sound hasn't been easy, but it would have been harder if I didn't have some awesome friends that make an effort to keep in touch, come to visit when they can, and generally do their part to keep me in good spirits.
  * **A good job**: I complain a bit about my job, but I am thankful for it. Relative financial stability is a wonderful thing, and I know I'm in the right line of work for now.
  * **My desire to continue learning and improving myself**: Not to toot my own horn, but I am thankful and proud that even though I am out of school and am a working stiff now, I continue to try and learn new things and improve myself. It's not just the learning, either, but also the physical stuff I am doing for my body and self. Losing weight has been tough, and two years in braces won't be easy (I start the orthodontic journey January 6th, wish me luck), but I am thankful I have a positive attitude about it, and am proud of myself for doing these things instead of just pushing them aside or to the back of my mind.
  * **Music**: I guess this is a little over-indulgent, but I am thankful for music. Both music I listen to and music I write/perform. It's such an important part of my life -- I don't know where I'd be without it. I have a hard time remembering what life was like without an iPod these days.

I guess it's kind of short, but it's my list.
