I have a tradition on Thanksgiving: I listen to Arlo Guthrie's classic *Alice's Restaurant Massacre*; all 18 minutes and 37 seconds of it. I don't remember exactly where I picked up this tradition, but it feels distinctly *mine* since it's not something that my family did growing up.

Anyway, I found out yesterday that the song is available on Spotify in its full-length glory. So kick back, close your eyes for 20 minutes, and enjoy.
