The article is in the form of a sort of sci-fi story, and is only one of
several articles (I think) that were published by the [ACM][1]. I'm not the
biggest fan of Stallman (he's far too big a hippie for my tastes), but I think
the article's use of extremes illustrates some excellent points about the
tendency of government to get all up in our electronic business. Anyway, I
enjoyed it. At first glance, it seems very outlandish, but when you think
about it and read the author's notes, it becomes clear that the sad future
isn't far away.
