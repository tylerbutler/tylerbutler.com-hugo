If you haven't heard of the [Mountain Goats][1], then you are in for a real
treat. I've been a huge fan since 2005. I actually heard about them from a
girl I met during my interview with Microsoft while in Seattle. I picked up a
few tracks off of Tallahassee from iTunes, and I've been in love ever since.
[John Darnielle][2] is utterly stunning -- the lyrics consistently blow me
away. I mean, it's _poetry_. The fact that it's set to music is just icing on
an already orgasmic cake. If there is one musician who deserves comparison to
Dylan -- it's Darnielle. Anyway, my buddy [Vlad][3] recently discovered them,
and so I thought it time to share the amazingness with the world at large.

Oh, and if you haven't tried [Grooveshark][4] yet, give it a whirl. The music
selection is surprisingly large, and being able to link friends directly to
songs and embed them on the web is _killer_. The UI is a bit weird and awkward
-- but I assume it'll evolve over time.
