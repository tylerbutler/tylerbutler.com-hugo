We've changed the way we're managing and releasing updates here in the
SharePoint team. This is all very good news. It makes things more manageable
internally for us, which translates into quicker, more effective turnaround on
issues, but it also means that updates and patches will be much more
predictable, so you can plan around those dates more effectively. There is
still recourse for you if you have an absolutely critical issue that needs to
be resolved ASAP.
