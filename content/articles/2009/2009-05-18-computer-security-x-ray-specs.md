IT security consultant Rich Mogull gives some tips for seeing through the BS
in security press releases. It's aimed at the Mac community, but it has some
insightful info that applies across the board. In particular, I like his even-
handed evaluation of the relative security of both Windows and OS X:

> For many years Mac OS X did have an inherent security advantage over
Windows, but to those who understand the technologies within the operating
systems, those days are long past.

>

> The latest version of Windows (Vista, not that most people use it) is
provably more secure in the lab than the latest version of Mac OS X 10.5
Leopard. Leopard lacks proper implementation of the new anti-exploitation
technologies included in Vista, and, based on the number of Apple security
patches, experiences about as many vulnerabilities.

>

> When I see articles that defend Mac OS X based on the lack of Mac-specific
malicious software, and not on current technical capabilities, cybercrime
dynamics, or attack methods, I tend to be dubious.
