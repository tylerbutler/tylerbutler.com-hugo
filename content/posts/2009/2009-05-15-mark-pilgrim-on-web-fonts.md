I love Mark Pilgrim.

> Dynamic web fonts are coming. Actually they're already here, but most of Our
People haven't noticed yet. But they will, and that's going to be a huge boon
to somebody. I see you've decided that it won't be you. Well, have fun
shuffling your little bits of metal around. The rest of us will be over here,
using the only fonts we're allowed to use: Everything But Yours.
