[PNG][1] celebrated 30 years of independence on September 16, 2005. To
celebrate, I decorated my office at work, blew up some balloons, and served
[Tim Tams][2]. Pictures are in the PNG Independence 2005 Gallery. A few
of my co-workers joined in the celebration by putting up balloons and
listening to PNG music in my office. Not a bad way to waste time on a slow
Friday afternoon.
