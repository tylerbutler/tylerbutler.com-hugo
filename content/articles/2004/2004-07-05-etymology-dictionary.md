Haha, just kidding. Seriously, though -- Ricardo sent me this link to an online
etymology dictionary. I haven't had a chance to look at it as in depth as I'd
like, but I hope to over the next week or so. Looks like it could be a really
useful resource. Gosh, I turn out more like my dad every day...
