I really should be writing my novel right now, since it is due in six days and
I still have quite a bit to write, but this is just too cool. I heard about it
on the radio yesterday, and I wish I'd heard about it sooner, because I would
have ordered a turducken for Thanksgiving, instead of buying a bunch of fried
chicken from Popeye's, which is what I am probably going to do. What is a
turducken, you ask? Only the **coolest** thing ever known to man: It's a
boneless chicken stuffed in a bonless duck, stuffed in a boneless turkey. The
whole thing is stuffed with Cajun sausage, I believe. I should have known
something this awesome would come from the Cajun culture. Anyway, you can
actually purchase them online at [CajunGrocer.com][1], which I plan to do as
soon as the holiday is over. I'll let you know how it goes. My mouth is
watering already...
