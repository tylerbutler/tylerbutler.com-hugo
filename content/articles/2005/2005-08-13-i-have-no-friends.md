[Netflix ][2]has this (relatively) new Friends feature. When I went there the
other day, it kindly reminded me, with a happy-looking purple box that I have
no friends yet. Totally brightened my day. It would have been worse, but at
least there was a link there where I could get a friend if I needed one. Too
bad life's not that easy. Anyway, add me to your friends' list if you have
Netflix.

  
_Lest some of you get the wrong idea... All of the above is mostly sarcastic.
I have lots of friends. I just thought the fact that Netflix would blatantly
say "No friends yet" on their website was funny._
