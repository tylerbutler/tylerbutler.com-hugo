Dan Eden pleads with web developers to provide uncompressed CSS in addition to minified versions:

> Itâ€™s pretty tough starting out as a designer/developer. You must remember those days of sitting on support forums, relentlessly refreshing and waiting for an answer to "How does website x do this with CSS?"

As someone who learns best by doing, I have to agree. Despite excellent new sources of information like StackOverflow, starting out as a web developer/designer is difficult. I certainly learned a lot -- and still do -- from looking at the CSS of sites that I find interesting.

You might not be able to do this for a large business site for business reasons, but there's no real excuse for a personal site. I've [added this][1] to the list of things to bake into Engineer.
