If you browse around the internet these days, you're bound to come across a
website that has an intro page. Usually this page allows you to choose whether
you have a high- or low-bandwidth connection. If you select the high-bandwidth
option, you invariably get taken to a Flash version of the site, while the
low-bandwidth version of the site is static HTML.

  
When faced with these types of choices, I often forget that one should _always_
pick the low-bandwidth option, even if one is using a high-bandwidth
connection. The main reason is that these Flash sites often have annoying
background music or annoying animations. From a site design perspective, Flash
is best used as a _supplementary_ web technology. A website shouldn't be
designed entirely in Flash. Some core reasons for this are accessibility and
search-ability. Google and other spiders cannot crawl a Flash web site as
easily. Not to mention the fact that these types of sites always have some
crazy navigation scheme and flashy transitions between sections that make it
very difficult to navigate around, because it doesn't fit the typical web
mold. Finally, Flash sites are typically absolutely scaled at a specific
resolution, which means they don't look or work great if they're not at a
specific window size. To combat this, they'll pop open a separate browser
window at the specific size they want. Talk about annoying! There is very
rarely _any_ need at all to design your site in Flash completely. Many 
Flash-only site have a stripped down HTML version of the site, hence the intro page
where you pick which version you want to see. Since you already have to create
an HTML version of the site, why not scrap the flash site and focus your
attention on making the HTML site much better?

  
The trend of completely Flash-based web sites has declined dramatically in the
commercial web of late, which is a great development. Instead, sites are using
Flash as a way to add a bit of pizzazz to the site in strategic places, or to
add a slightly more interactive portion to their site. Judicious use of Flash
in this way is good.

  
The next time someone tells you that you should design your entire web
presence in Flash, or have two versions of your site, shoot them.
