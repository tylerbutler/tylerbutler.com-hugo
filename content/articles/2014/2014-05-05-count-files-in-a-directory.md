Need to count files in a directory? Try this one line of PowerShell:

```powershell
(dir | where {$_.GetType() -match "fileInfo"} | measure-object).count
```

You can also add a `-r` parameter (`-r` means *recursive*) to the first `dir`[^1] command and get a complete count of all files in all subdirectories under the current path.

This comes in handy, though I *do* wish it was a little more succinct.


[^1]: And of course you can substitute `ls` for `dir` if you prefer, or even `Get-ChildItem` if you're feeling particularly masochistic.
