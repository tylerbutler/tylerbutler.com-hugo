I've been using [Day One][1] for the past few months to encourage my own journaling, and while I've not been as consistent as I'd hoped, the app is pretty good. Dropbox syncing seems to work pretty well too. It's free this week [on the App Store][2].

If you pick it up, you might also check out [Slogger][3].
