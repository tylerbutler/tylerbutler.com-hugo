Peter M. De Lorenzo of [Autoextremist](http://www.autoextremist.com/current/2012/11/26/the-autoextremist.html):

> We only have to look as far as the VW Group to see how things are dramatically unfolding. As most industry insiders know, the VW Group, led by the maniacal genius, Ferdinand Piech, is on an unbelievable roll right now. The VW Group boasts twelve brands from seven European countries: Volkswagen, Audi, Bentley, Bugatti, Lamborghini, Porsche (and SEAT, SKODA, Ducati motorcycles, Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles, Scania and MAN).

I had no idea that the VW Group includes Bentley, Lamborghini, and Porsche.
