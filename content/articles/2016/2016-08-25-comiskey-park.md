Well, it's happened again. They've gone and [renamed Comiskey Park][1] to
something else. And I feel about the same way [I did back in 2004][2], when
the last name change happened.

I lived a few blocks from the park at that time, as opposed to the few thousand
I do now, but it still upsets me. Whatever happens, it'll always be Comiskey
Park to me.
