Imagine my surprise when I was browsing my feeds at Google Reader today to see
the word "Pidgin" in my feeds. And in a Lifehacker post, no less! To
understand why I would be surprised, you have to remember that I grew up in
Papua New Guinea, where a trade language called [Neo-Melanesian Pidgin][1]
(Tok Pisin in the [vernacular][2]) is spoken by roughly 4 million people
there. It is commonly referred to as just "pidgin" by people that live in PNG.

In reality, pidgin is a generic linguistic term that refers to a language that
develops as a means to facilitate trade in areas where many different
languages are spoken by small people groups. Since ~850 languages are spoken
in PNG, it makes some sense that a pidgin would be born to facilitate trade
and communication. Neo-Melanesian pidgin is based on English and German. One
of the defining characteristics of pidgins is that they are typically just a
[lingua franca][3], and not spoken as a first language by any people group.
Pidgins sometimes develop into creoles, which means that they then become more
full-fledged languages, because people learn to speak them as their first (and
sometimes only) language. This is the case with Haitian Creole (originally a
French Pidgin, now a French Creole).

Anyhow, the Pidgin Lifehacker was talking about is an IM client, much like
Trillian. Not quite what I was expecting, but given what a pidgin is, the name
is fitting. :-)
