## Overview

tylerbutler.com is built using [Engineer][] and serves as a playground or sandbox for various
web applications and ideas I am playing around with, along with occasional articles or links.

The source for the Engineer pieces of the site are [on github][1]. The articles themselves are
stored in Dropbox and synchronized between all of my devices, so I can write anywhere.
