Apparently, K-Mart has recalled some Martha Stewart brand matches because they
**"may ignite upon impact."** Nope, I am not kidding. It is really
unbelievable that a retail store has to be **this** frightened of lawsuits to
do this. Can we all just agree to stop being stupid so stuff like this can
stop happening? Please? With sugar on top?
