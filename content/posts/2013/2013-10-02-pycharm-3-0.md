JetBrains released version 3.0 of their [excellent Python IDE](http://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/index.html) a couple of weeks ago, and with it they made a free Community Edition available as well. I can't say enough good things about PyCharm, so if you've been on the fence about it, it's worth checking out the Community Edition. They've put together a nice [edition comparison chart](http://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/features/editions_comparison_matrix.html) so you can see the core differences.

If you're looking to do Django/Flask/Pyramid/Google App Engine development, you'll likely want the Pro edition, but it's still reasonably priced in my opinion (compare it to [Xamarin](https://store.xamarin.com/), for example[^pycharm1]) and speaking from experience, the Django support, at least, is very good. I haven't checked out the Flask support yet, but [xkcd2](http://www.xkcd2.com) would be a good testing ground.

If you want to see what a *real project* might look like in PyCharm, you can always clone [Engineer](https://github.com/tylerbutler/engineer/). It's been built using PyCharm since day one.


[^pycharm1]: Yes, I know it's kind of an apples to oranges comparison given that they have different capabilities and target different languages, but they're both IDEs...
