One of my peeves is having to register for websites just to _view_ their
content. You'll notice that while you do have to sign up for my site to post
comments (the reasoning is in [this post][1]), my content is always visible to
everyone.

  
That's one reason I love [BugMeNot.com][2], a website that stores usernames
and passwords that can be used to access these types of sites without
registering yourself. There's even a [nifty Firefox extension][3] that will
automatically fill in forms with BugMeNot data for you. Do you need any more
reason to get Firefox?

  
Anyway, there's [a story at the NYTimes site][1] about "life's little
annoyances," and it mentions having to register for websites. But guess what,
in order to read New York Times articles online, you have to register. Gosh,
that's dumb. Perfect time to try out BugMeNot.com! The article itself is
interesting, though, and has some good ideas about how to stick it to the junk
mail advertisers. I think I'm going to start doing some of the stuff in there,
like stuffing Business reply envelopes with heavy paper and sending it back
just to make the company pay for the postage. Take **that** suckers!
