I rarely go to the Google homepage, but I wound up there today and was surprised to see a [Doodle][] very reminiscent of [Crown Hall][]. Sure enough, it's an homage to [Ludwig Mies van der Rohe][] -- or simply *Mies* as he was always referred to on campus while I was there[^1] -- whose birthday was today in 1886. Very cool.

[^1]: If Wikipedia is to be trusted, referring to him simply as *Mies* is widespread. I had always assumed this was an IIT-only thing given his importance to the campus and College of Architecture there.
