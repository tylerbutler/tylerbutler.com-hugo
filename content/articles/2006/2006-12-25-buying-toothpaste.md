I had to buy a new tube of toothpaste the other day. This isn't something I do
terribly often. I live alone, and even with my braces, which requires a more
stringent dental hygiene regiment, I don't go through a tube that quickly.

But as I browsed the seemingly endless toothpaste section at my local Fred
Meyer, looking for a tube, I realized that I have never bought the same type
of toothpaste twice. I get to the store and I realize that I don't know what
type I bought last time, and all of the tubes look the same and have
frustratingly similar names. _Did I get Mint Zing last time? Or was it Fresh
Mint? Maybe it was Minty Freshâ€¦ Yeah, it was Minty Fresh._

Nope, it wasn't Minty Fresh. It wasn't even Fresh Mint or Mint Zing. It was
**Mega Mint with Scope, Baking Soda and Peroxide Whitening ++**. _Sigh_. Why
does it have to be so hard to buy freaking toothpaste?
