# Hugo Site CSS/HTML Modernization Plan

## Current State Analysis

**Libraries & Dependencies:**
- jQuery 2.2.4 (from Microsoft CDN)
- Bigfoot.js (for footnotes) 
- Semantic UI sticky component
- Foundation 6 CSS framework (partial usage)
- SASS-based styling
- Gulp build system in theme

**Layout Patterns:**
- Foundation 6 grid system (`small-`, `medium-`, `large-` classes)
- Float-based layouts
- Custom SASS mixins for typography and colors
- Old-style CSS with prefixed properties
- Inline JavaScript for component initialization

## Modernization Strategy

### Phase 1: Visual Regression Testing Setup
**Tool Recommendation: Playwright**
- Native Hugo compatibility
- Built-in screenshot comparison
- Cross-browser testing capabilities
- CI/CD integration ready

```bash
npm install -D @playwright/test
```

### Phase 2: CSS Grid/Flexbox Migration
**Priority Order:**
1. Replace Foundation grid with CSS Grid for main layouts
2. Convert float-based sidebar to flexbox  
3. Update responsive breakpoints to modern approach
4. Replace SASS mixins with CSS custom properties

### Phase 3: JavaScript Modernization  
**Remove Dependencies:**
- Replace jQuery with vanilla JavaScript
- Replace Bigfoot.js with modern footnote solution
- Remove Semantic UI sticky (use `position: sticky`)
- Eliminate CDN dependencies

### Phase 4: Modern CSS Features
**Upgrades:**
- Convert SASS variables to CSS custom properties
- Use `clamp()` for responsive typography
- Implement container queries where beneficial
- Add CSS logical properties for better i18n
- Use modern color functions (oklch/lch)

### Phase 5: HTML Semantic Improvements
- Add proper ARIA labels
- Implement semantic HTML5 elements
- Optimize for accessibility
- Add microdata/structured data

## Testing Strategy

### Baseline Screenshots
Capture current design across:
- Desktop (1920x1080, 1366x768)
- Tablet (768x1024) 
- Mobile (375x667, 414x896)

### Component-Level Testing
Individual screenshots of:
- Header/navigation
- Article layouts
- Sidebar components
- Footer
- Code blocks

### Cross-Browser Coverage
Chrome, Firefox, Safari

## Implementation Approach

**Incremental Migration:**
- Keep both old and new CSS during transition
- Use feature detection for progressive enhancement
- Test each component individually
- Maintain Hugo's static generation performance

**Rollback Strategy:**
- Git branches for each phase
- Feature flags for new CSS
- Automated screenshot comparison in CI
- Performance monitoring
