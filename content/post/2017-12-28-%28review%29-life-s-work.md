It's not often in today's modern world that you hear about a "life's work." In my own experience, such a phrase is reserved for talking about the past. Artists of a bygone era completing their "life's work," the culmination of an entire lifetime of effort towards the realization of a single work - a piece of music, a sculpture, a painting... Or a book.

As some of you know, I grew up in Papua New Guinea with my parents and sister, who still call the island their home today. I was blessed with this amazing life because my parents decided to move to the middle of nowhere in 1979 so they could translate the Bible into a language spoken by a few hundred people in the jungle of the East Sepik province.

It is difficult to clearly communicate the enormity of such a task. When my parents moved to the village of Likan, the Waran people had no written language. Waran was a spoken language only. There were few Waran people who were literate in any language, and none who were literate in their *own* language, since it had no written form.

So the first thing my dad had to do was learn the language itself. Imagine - you've moved to the middle of the jungle, hours away (by canoe) from any semblance of civilization. You don't speak the language. No one that does speak the language can teach you directly. Your ultimate task? To translate the Bible into that language and publish it so that the people can read it.

But before you can do any of that, you need to learn the language yourself, create a written alphabet, and teach the people to read and write their own language. Then you need 

And on top of all of that, you have to figure out how to survive in a jungle environment.

Dad called it a "visceral experience."
