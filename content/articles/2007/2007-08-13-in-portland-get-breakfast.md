Seriously, the next time you're in Portland, go to [Sanborn's][1] and get some breakfast. Freaking **_amazing_**
food. Elizabeth and I went there last weekend during our trip down there.
Despite the fact that we got lost (I blame our crummy GPS technology -- or
maybe it was the navigator?), once we found it it lived up to the hype.
Definitely get the biscuits -- I am drooling right now just thinking about
them… The pancakes and omelette's were also very very good. It was busy, but
service was decent. We also went to [Lucy's Table][4] for dinner,
which I can also highly recommend. Excellent food and service, though it was a
bit pricey. I'd liken it to Café Juanita in Kirkland in terms of quality and
atmosphere. Unfortunately, not all of our dining experiences in the City of
Roses were good. Despite good reviews on CitySearch, the [J&M Café][6] left a lot to be desired. Not outright **_bad_**, but definitely nothing to write home about. Meh. And also note that the only [Sonic][8] within 200 miles of Seattle is in a Portland suburb. Mmmmmm, **_so_** worth the drive.
