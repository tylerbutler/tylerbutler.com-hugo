I have, after much thought, decided to disable anonymous commenting on this
site. For one thing, there are actually blog spammers who hit me with a few
long non-sensical spam comments every once in awhile. But I could deal with
that -- and if I had the time, I could even upgrade [Geeklog][1] so it would
block most of the spam. But that wasn't the real problem -- the real problem is
that people post comments and I have absolutely no idea who they are. Most of
my friends are nice -- Patrick and Kim usually sign their comment posts, which
is nice. There are, however, a few people who never do, and I am forced to go
looking through my access logs to figure out what IP accessed the site at the
approximate time the comment was posted, then lookup the IP and see if I can
think of anyone I might know that uses ISP. While I certainly do enjoy being
[Sherlock Holmes][2] on occasion, this is just too much. So Pat, Kim, Ricardo,
and anyone else who indulges me by reading this, please just set yourself up an
account and post your comments -- I really do like it when you post comments.
It makes me feel all warm and bubbly inside.
