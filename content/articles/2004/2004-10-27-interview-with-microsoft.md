Microsoft is coming to campus on Thursday and Friday of this week, and I
managed to get an interview. One of the guys who's coming is an alumnus from
IIT, and he used to be in [my IPRO][1] (back before it became **_my_** IPRO),
and he sent me an email asking if I knew of anyone from the IPRO that I would
recommend he interview. I gave him the only name I could in good conscience,
and suggested he interview me as well. So he asked for my resume, and I got an
email this afternoon requesting my preference for an interview time. I'm not
sure if any of it's going to pan out, but it's a good opportunity nonetheless.
I'm also not too sure how I feel about working for MS, but I'll cross that
bridge if/when I come to it. Wish me luck!

Well, I made it past the first two hurdles. The on-campus interview went well,
and I must have impressed Ondrej enough that he pushed my resume on through to
an official recruiter. The recruiter emailed me today about setting up a phone
interview Wednesday next week. The way I understand it is that if the phone
interview goes well, then I'll be heading out to Redmond for an on-site
interview. Then, if they're _really_ interested, I'll get an offer.

  
Anyway, I am excited, but would appreciate your thoughts and prayers. This is
a big deal for me. I'm keeping my fingers crossed.

Well, I finally heard back from them today, and they are moving me through to
the next stage of the interview. I still don't know the logistics yet, and it
kind of throws a wrench in the works with my current plans for next semester,
but I'm sure I can work something out if I get an offer. :-)

Looks like I am flying out to Seattle on February 7th, interviewing on the
8th, then flying back on the 9th. I am excited, but a little nervous as well.
Hopefully I'll impress them.
