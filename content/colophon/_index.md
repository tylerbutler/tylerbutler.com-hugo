This site is built using [Engineer](/projects/engineer), a static site generator I wrote myself after
being inspired by [Brent Simmons][], Marco Arment's Second Crack, Jekyll, Octopress,
and Hyde. It's written in [Python][] and uses [Jinja2][] for templating. I use the management site
available with Engineer (aka Emma) to manage my posts, which in turn runs on [Bottle][].

The design of the site is also by me and comes bundled as the default theme in Engineer. It
makes heavy use of the excellent [Foundation framework][].

Fonts are [Museo Slab][], [Myriad Pro][], [Anonymous Pro][], and [Kulturista Web][],
all served via [Typekit][].

Most of my site and projects are hosted at [WebFaction][], but [NearlyFreeSpeech.net][] serves some of
it occasionally as well. Domain hosting is handled by [Hover][].
