I am almost done transferring all of the content from the old tylerbutler.com
site to the new format. There are still some sections that I am working on,
but it should be done pretty soon. As you can see, the new stuff is now at the
root of the site. The old site is still visible at http://www.tylerbutler.com/oldsite.
