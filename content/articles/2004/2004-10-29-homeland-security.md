OK, this is ridiculous. The Department of Homeland Security can't find
anything better to do, apparently, than harass small business owners. Check
out this [Yahoo News story][1]:

> ST. HELENS, Ore. - So far as she knows, Pufferbelly Toys owner Stephanie Cox
hasn't been passing any state secrets to sinister foreign governments, or
violating obscure clauses in the Patriot Act.

> So she was taken aback by a mysterious phone call from the U.S. Department of
Homeland Security to her small store in this quiet Columbia River town just
north of Portland.

> "I was shaking in my shoes," Cox said of the September phone call. "My first
thought was the government can shut your business down on a whim, in my
opinion. If I'm closed even for a day that would cause undue stress."

> When the two agents arrived at the store, the lead agent asked Cox whether she
carried a toy called the Magic Cube, which he said was an illegal copy of the
Rubik's Cube, one of the most popular toys of all time.

> He told her to remove the Magic Cube from her shelves, and he watched to make
sure she complied.

> After the agents left, Cox called the manufacturer of the Magic Cube, the
Toysmith Group, which is based in Auburn, Wash. A representative told her that
Rubik's Cube patent had expired, and the Magic Cube did not infringe on the
rival toy's trademark.

> Virginia Kice, a spokeswoman for **Immigration and Customs Enforcement**, said
agents went to Pufferbelly based on a trademark infringement complaint filed
in the agency's intellectual property rights center in Washington, D.C.

> **"One of the things that our agency's responsible for doing is protecting the integrity of the economy and our nation's financial systems and obviously trademark infringement does have significant economic implications,"** she said.
Six weeks after her brush with Homeland Security, Cox told The Oregonian she
is still bewildered by the experience.

> "Aren't there any terrorists out there?" she said.

I have several problems with this whole event. First of all, why is the
"protection" of our nation's economy the responsibility of the government at
all, least of all the DHS? We're supposed to be [relatively] free market,
right? Second, why is someone from the **Immigration and Customs Enforcement**
office doing the commenting? This makes even less sense! Third, it's a Rubik's
Cube for crying out loud! And the patent's expired! Finally, wasn't the DHS
created to safeguard our country from terrorists? Even if terrorists **were**
infringing on trademarks (which I seriously doubt they are), I'd still rather
the DHS leave them alone if they can't actually tell a terrorist from a small
business owner.

On the other hand, had this happened to me I probably would have asked for
some paperwork or something proving they had authority to do this, but then,
we live in a culture of fear here in the US, so I can't say I blame Ms. Cox
for simply complying. She hadn't done anything wrong, after all. What did she
have to fear? (The answer is _everything_. Government sucks. And yes, I am
[paranoid][2].)
