[George][1] found [this article][2] over at SearchVB.com that mentions my [MIX
'07 Session][3]. While I am not quoted directly, my name is mentioned, and the
content of the session is referenced a bit:

> At Microsoft's MIX07 conference, Tyler Butler, a program manager for
> Microsoft Office SharePoint Server, pointed out three Web applications built
> on SharePoint -- Hawaiian Airlines, mobile phone game firm Glu Mobile and
> music and event firm Hed Kandi Radio.
>
> Butler also indicated that, since the SharePoint 2007 platform is built on
> ASP.NET 2.0, developers can use ASP.NET AJAX and Silverlight to provide a rich
> user interface.

I'll try not to let the fame go to my head.
