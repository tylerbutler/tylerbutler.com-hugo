In my line of work, I deal with uppity people every day. When you're in the
position to serve people, you will no doubt encounter countless people who
think their problem is more important than everyone else's. This is to be
expected. But what really gets me is when some fool appends their official job
title to the end of their email communications, or in a phone conversation,
for the sole purpose of getting better service because they're "important." If
anything, it makes me do the exact _opposite_. If they think they're that
important, then screw them. I do not care if you're the executive vice consul
presidential aid's assistant. You will wait, just like everyone else. Screw
you and your self-important ego. We'll see how you talk to me when I'm a
millionaire at 25.

  
**PS.** Something else that bugs me is people that feel it necessary to include _all_ of their titles in their email signature. This is especially troublesome for students. For example, there was a semester when I could have signed all my emails like this:
  
Tyler Butler  
President, Delta Tau Delta, Gamma Beta Chapter  
President, Keygrips Films  
Technical Manager, OTS Support Desk  
Team Lead, IPRO 305, HawkTour Project
  
Now really... for any given email, only **one** title makes sense. I don't
need to notify the world that I am involved in lots of different things. If I
write an email where a title the pertains to me is relevant, then I'll include
it. Otherwise, I'll let my actions, not my titles, speak for me.
