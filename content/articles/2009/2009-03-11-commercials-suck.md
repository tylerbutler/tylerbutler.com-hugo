This article, titled "[Give Us a Commercial Break!][1]" from the Wall Street
Journal is **way** off the mark in my opinion. The article states that TV
shows are written with commercials in mind and that watching them without
commercials changes them. That in and of itself I can't argue with. But I do
take issue with the implication that this is uniformly bad.

There are two core arguments in the article:

  1. TV shows are written with commercials specifically in mind, and removing them completely interrupts the pacing of the show. 
  2. Viewers actually like shows with ads better.

For argument number one, it's obvious that writers take commercial breaks into
consideration when writing TV shows. However, in their DVD counterparts, the
breaks are preserved as scene changes. These can seem rather abrupt, and I
think this points to an alternative solution: slightly longer breaks for scene
changes that are replacing commercial breaks. If we assume the normal scene
change is a second, then imagine that the commercial-break-replacement scene
change is three seconds. You can simulate this suggestion by hitting pause for
three seconds – I think you'll be surprised at the results. I think you'll
agree that this is uniformly better than ads.

For argument number two, I can't refute the research. But there is a quote
from the article that is completely asinine in my opinion:

> From an audience member's perspective, they are what makes network
television social. We use the commercial breaks to talk amongst ourselves, to
take bets on the J.D./Elliot situation and to decide that no one ever really
dies on "Lost."

Say what? That we need commercial breaks to be social is ridiculous. In this
day and age, we have ready access to the Pause button, and it's a far more
useful tool for fostering discussion while watching TV. Elizabeth and I
have been watching quite a few documentaries lately, and we pause quite often
to talk about whether or not we agree with what's being said. I agree that
adding discussion and dialog while viewing a show is positive (there's a
reason fans get together to watch episodes of their favorite shows), but I
think people use the commercial breaks because they're there, not because they
**need** them in order to have that conversation successfully.

I hate ads in all forms (though I can appreciate particularly clever or well-
done ones), so I am definitely biased here. But seriously... there's a reason
DVD copies of shows sell so well, and it isn't because people are dying to own
season one of “Scrubs” for eternity...
