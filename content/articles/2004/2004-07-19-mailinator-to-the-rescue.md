Ricardo sent me this website, [Mailinator.net][1]. It's a really cool concept
for people who need to sign up for websites once or need to enter an email
address on a form for some reason. You don't need an account - you make up the
name on the spot, then the account is created automatically when a message is
received. Then you log in, get the message, and leave. The account is
automatically deleted later! What a cool concept! Check out their website for
more info.
