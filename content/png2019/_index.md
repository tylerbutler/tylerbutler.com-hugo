Many folks don't know this (and those who do often forget) but I grew up in Papua New Guinea. My parents and sister still live and work there. In June 2019, I will be returning to PNG for the first time since 2001, and you are invited to join me. If this sounds at all interesting to you, read on.

While there are a number of reasons I'm taking this trip, the biggest one is that my mom and dad, after almost 40 years of life and work in PNG, have completed the translation of the New Testament of the Bible into Waran, one of the over 850 languages spoken in PNG, and my Waran family is going to have a party. **Believe me when I say that a Waran party is not to be missed!**

This is going to be a trip jam-packed with activity...

## Madang

We'll spend time in Madang, where my parents and sister now live, and where the organization they work with is headquartered.

Madang is a coastal town, so it's beautiful and there are standard coastal activities to be enjoyed, like snorkeling and scuba diving, and we'll most likely take a boat to one of the many small islands off the coast, like [Kranket][] or one of the private islands that my sister has access to.

My sister also has friends in villages around Madang, and can arrange for us to visit and see some traditional sing-sings (sort of like [the one in this video][singsing], but there are hundreds of different cultures in PNG and their dress and dances differ).

We'll visit Madang's outdoor market, see [flying foxes with 2-4 feet wingspans][bats], and eat amazing fruit like passionfruit, mangoes, pineapples, guavas, and of course bananas.

## Likan and Yar

We'll take a prop plane -- possibly something like a [Twin Otter][] -- to the village where I grew up, Likan, which is in the East Sepik province. You won't find it on a map, but it's there. I promise.

While in Likan, we'll spend time in the river running next to my village, talk and interact with the folks in the village, and get a taste for life in the jungles of PNG! Oh, and I plan to get as much video footage of the village as my hard drive can store!

From Likan, we'll take a river canoe to another village, Yar. That's where the dedication will be held, but there is no airstrip there so we'll get to ride the river! **This is a truly one-of-a-kind experience!**

## Ukarumpa

{{< youtube EnKaevXEj_w >}}

We'll also visit Ukarumpa, where I went to high school. It's in the Eastern Highlands province at about 5,000 feet (1,500 meters) elevation. Ukarumpa is on a map, and Google Earth actually has [pretty good satellite imagery of it.][1] We can fly there, but the more adventurous among us will take the road unless there's some reason we can't.

And much, much more... ðŸ˜Š

## FAQ

### How long will this trip be?
I am hoping to take 4-6 weeks of vacation for the whole trip, but I don't expect most folks to do that. I think three weeks is the best duration to aim for. That will provide enough time to recover from the long travel and allow us to fully enjoy the variety of experiences that can be had in PNG. It's a small country, but you willbe astounded at how varied it is!

Because the New Testament Dedication is the focal point of this visit, I think most people should arrive about a week before the dedication, and leave two week after. People will be traveling in separate groups, so arrivals and departures are going to be varied. We're fortunate that my sister is a **Logistics Ninja**... But I think we're going to quite indebted to her!

### How much will it cost?
PNG is in a difficult-to-access part of the world. While I'm organizing the trip and will help with the logistics of in-country travel, you'll have to get to the country yourself. *Very* rough estimate is $3-5,000 per person all-up, a large chunk of which is going to be the flights to get to the country. I encourage you to do your own research on costs as well; everyone's standard of travel is different. Over the next few months as plans solidify, I'll get better estimates for the in-country travel costs from my sister.

### Can I bring someone with me, like my spouse or a travel partner? What about kids?
Sure! Everyone is welcome. The one thing to note is that getting to PNG is quite a journey, and if you have young kids the long flights can be rough. The same applies to in-country travel, since road conditions are, shall we say, *rural.*

### Is Papua New Guinea safe?
Yes. The people of PNG are extremely hospitable and friendly. Language can be a barrier, but you might find you pick up Tok Pisin faster than you expect. In addition, you're going to be accompanied by me and my family, who have lived in PNG for 40 years (or her entire life in the case of my sister) and will help acclimate you to the culture. In short, you've got connections, my friend.

PNG also has an equatorial tropical climate, and is thus host to several tropical nasties, like malaria. You're going to be in the jungle, so you'll want to be prepared with DEET, malaria medication, talk to your doctor, etc. Prepare for this trip like you would any visit to a tropical country with mosquitos and the like.

### Some of this sounds great, but some of it may be beyond my comfort level. Can I just stay in Madang?
Of course! If you want to join us but don't want to head out to my village or something, we can probably arrange it. That said, it's hard for me to overstate how amazing visiting my village and the Waran people will be. This is an opportunity that you probably won't get again in your lifetime.

### I'd like to visit some other places while I'm in that part of the world. Can I do that?
Sure. My wife and I are considering visiting family in New Zealand after PNG. Australia, Indonesia, the Philippines, and Fiji are all close by! Nothing's stopping you from knocking two or three more things off your bucket list!

I can personally vouch for Australia. It's awesome, and I'm hoping this shameless plug will encourage some of my friends there to invite us to visit them as well. HINT HINT.
