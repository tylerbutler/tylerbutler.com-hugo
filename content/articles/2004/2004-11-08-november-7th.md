**Chapter 8: The Weakest Link**

The train didn't seem to be moving as quickly as it had the last time he'd
ridden, mont hs ago. He was getting restless. The executives would be
expecting him momentarily. He glanced at his watch for the millionth time.
Time seemed to be slogging along at an incredibly slow rate.

The jagged cuts on his knuckles had stopped bleeding, and now pulsated a
dull pain through his entire right hand. He'd inadvertently gotten blood on
his fresh white shirt and dark tie; he probably wouldn't have the time to
clean himself up before the meeting -- if he even made it.

Thee train creaked to a stop. Was this it? No, one more to go. He examined
his appearance in the low-contrast reflection of the train window. Wow, he was
a wreck; hair mussed up from the run, the gritty dull white powder of dried
sweat on his forehead, blood on his shirt, collar and tie loose and wrinkled.
He certainly didn't look like a poster child for one of the most powerful
advertising firms in the city.

A wave of anger passed over him, largely directed at Marie. After all, it
was _her_ fault that all of this was happening. If she'd made sure he was up
this morning, he could have gotten on the road earlier. Granted, it was he
that was out late last night, but _that_ was her fault too. If she'd kept him
satisfied, he wouldn't have had the need to stay out late cheating on her to
satisfy his sexual appetite. See, it was all her fault. He ought to leave her.
Well, she'd be kissing the nice house in the Glade goodbye if he didn't get
his bonus. At least this affected her as much as it affected him -- she
wouldn't get away scot-free.

After what seemed like an eternity, the train finally made it to State
Avenue , and not a moment too soon. Mike grabbed his briefcase and hurried out
the door, pushing past the mob of people and ignoring their shouted protests
as he continued along.

The path along State Avenue to the tower was relatively clear; it was so
late in the morning, a majority of people had already made it to their jobs.
His previous physical activity had left his body reeling, and he was unable to
move faster than a brisk walk towards the tower. He pushed his way through the
revolving doors and ignored the pleasant greetings of the security guard as he
headed straight to the elevator.

He pressed the up button urgently, somehow feeling that the faster he
pressed it, the faster the elevator would descend. The pristine ding of the
elevator's arrival could not come soon enough, and he boarded the car
anxiously. He was followed by two other nicely dressed individuals who ogled
his appearance as they boarded. He forced himself to smile smoothly, despite
his strong desire to rip their heads off. Who the hell did they think they
were?

“34, please.” He murmured at the two other passengers as the doors slid to a
close with a hiss. A brief downward force signaled their ascent, and Mike
looked at his watch again. Shit, it was going to be close. The other
passengers departed at the 18 th floor, taking their time, much to Mike's
chagrin. He pressed the door close button even more urgently than he had the
elevator call, and leaned back against the far elevator wall with an anxious
sigh. Fortunately for his sanity, it appeared no one else had any need to use
the elevator at this late morning hour, and his trip to the 34 th floor
continued uninterrupted.

The doors opened and Mike flew out frantically, briskly heading towards his
office to grab the collection of charts and mock-ups for the new campaign.

“Oh, Mr. Turner, I'm so glad you're here! They're waiting for you in the
conference room! Oh my, are you all right? Do you need...”

“No, Susan, just let them know I am on my way right now. I'll be there in a
minute.” He tightened his tie and buttoned the top button of his collar, then
quickly glanced at himself in the glass reflection of his office window. Well,
this was as good as it was going to get. He pulled the rolled posters from his
desk and walked towards the conference room.

He pushed the door to the conference room open with his back, and turned to
notice that a majority of the management staff was present. That was odd -- he
thought this was just between Bill, his direct supervisor, a few of the other
executives, and himself. And what was Marlene doing here? She shouldn't have
anything do with this.

“Ah, Mike, glad you made it... Oh, are you all right? Do you need a few
minutes?” Bill stood in greeting.

“No, no, I'm OK. I just cut my hand on my way over. No big deal.”

“Well, all right then. Go ahead and have a seat.” There was something
strange in his demeanor. He was too professional, too friendly. He and Mike
were barely on speaking terms -- why the charade? And what were all these
_people_ doing here?

“Mike, as you know, we're here to talk about the Richmond account...”

“Yeah, yeah, I've got some mock-ups here for you to look at.” Mike
interrupted in excitement. He was especially proud of his ideas for the new
campaign. They were quite possibly his best, and equipped with the right team,
he could really deliver the goods on this one.

He reached down for one of the rolled-up posters and began to unfold it. “As
you can see, I've totally rethought the logo and how it integrates with the
rest of the campaign, and I've got some new...”

“Well, Mike, let's just wait on that. You see, we've had a lot of discussion
about the Richmond account, and as you know, they haven't been pleased with
the latest campaign. We rely on their business, and we really need to pick up
the pace f we want to get them to sign a new con...”

Mike was annoyed. He already knew all of this. He knew how important the
account was, both to the company and his own career. Why did Bill have to
rehash all this stuff here?

“Yeah, I know, Bill, which is why I've totally rethought our approach, and
if you'd just give me a second to exp...”

“Please Mike,” Bill said, holding up his hand and shaking his head. “Please
let me finish. We... all of us...” He motioned to the rest of those in the
room. “We've decided that we need some new leadership on the Richmond account.
Marlene, as you know, has a working relationship with some of the Richmond
guys from her days at Alliance , and we think that she might be able to
leverage that relationship to produce some good results.”

Well, that explained Marlene's presence. “What the hell is going on, Bill?
Are you letting me go?” Mike could feel himself getting hot.

“In a word Mike... yes.” That son of a bitch. He looked around the room at
the rest of the observers. They all averted their gazes, looking at the floor
or out the window. Was this really happening?

He stood up suddenly, causing a gasp to ripple through the rest of those
present. Marlene pushed away from the table quickly. Bill stood up to meet
him, a nervous look on his face. He moved his hands slowly, obviously trying
to calm the situation.

“Now Mike, settle down...”

Mike didn't want to settle down. He didn't want to calm the situation. He
_wanted_ to rip into someone.

“This is why you called me down here, Bill? This is the meeting you told me
about _two weeks_ ago? This is what I've been preparing for, spending late
nights in this fucking office, cultivating and developing what is quite
possibly the most brilliant idea this firm has ever had? You son of a bitch!”

Mike advanced towards Bill. There was too much going through his head. He
couldn't think everything through. His blood was boiling! Did they honestly
think that Marlene, that _bitch_, was going to be able to take over for him?
He was the heart of this company -- Richmond was his account! What the hell
were they doing?

Bill backed away slowly, still moving his arms in a vain attempt to calm
Mike down.

“Come on Mike, you have to understand...”

“What?” Mike shouted. He was pissed now. “What do I have to understand,
Bill? Do you really think this little cunt can take the Richmond account?”
There was no answer. “Fine. Let her try!” With a roar, Mike turned and slammed
his right fist into the wall. Pain shot like hot needles through his arm, but
he didn't care.

He turned back to where his briefcase and posters sat, leaving a streak of
maroon conspicuously on the cream conference room wall. Someone must have
called the tower security; two hefty-looking gentlemen stood in the doorway
stolidly.

“Mike,” started Bill again, as Mike began to pick up his briefcase and mock-
ups. With mock-ups like these, he'd at least be able to get another job.

“Leave the stuff here. You know you can't take it with you.”

Shit, he was right. Nothing Mike had done while working at the company was
his -- it all belonged to Copeland. Those sons of bitches. He now understood
why they'd waited to tell him they'd decided to fire him; they knew he'd put
all of his energy into revamping the campaign if he thought he had an
opportunity to really change it. Now they could take his work, give it to
Marlene, and turn it into a money-making campaign. And all it cost them was
his severance pay.

“You're all sons of bitches, you know that?” He dropped the posters and
briefcase as the two stolid gentlemen grabbed his arms and led him towards the
elevators. His rage continued to mount as the elevator descended. He
considered his options. He could try to take out the two security men and go
on a rampage through the office, but sadly, he had no weapons. The men looked
pretty solid, anyway; he wouldn't be able to take both of them out.

This sucked. No amount of profanity murmured under his breath could fully
express the sense of betrayal he felt. As the security men dragged him out of
the elevator on the ground floor, a sudden weight fell down on him. The
adrenaline that his anger had brought forth unexpectedly dissipated, and he
felt light-headed. The last thing he saw before passing out was two delivery
men wheeling a large cake through the tower lobby. The icing read,
“Congratulations Marlene!”
