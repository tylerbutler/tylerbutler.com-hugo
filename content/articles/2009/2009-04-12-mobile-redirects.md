Listen up, site owners. I like it when I go to visit your site on my iPhone
and I get redirected to an iPhone version of your site. Really, I do. It's
nifty. But if you're not going to redirect me to the specific article I wanted
to read, or the specific page I asked for, then don't freakin' redirect me. I
didn't go to foobar.com/specific-article.aspx to get
foobar.com/iphone/home.aspx. They are not the same thing. If you don't have
the capability to serve the specific page I asked for in a mobile-friendly
format, then don't do anything.

Stop being idiots.
