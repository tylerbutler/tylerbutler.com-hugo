As a software designer, I ask myself these questions everyday: "Will a user be
able to figure this out? Is this intuitive?" Someone at Microsoft shared this
link with me. It's about bad designs of physical things, but the principles can be applied
to other design work. I don't agree with everything there, but it's a good
read nonetheless.
