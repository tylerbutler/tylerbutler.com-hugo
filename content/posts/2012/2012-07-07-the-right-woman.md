How you know you married the right woman:

You're on a road trip. To your horror, you discover that the rental car radio isn't working well, and your only option is to use the CD player. Of course, since this isn't 1995, you don't have any CDs.

"Wait!" she says. "I think I have *Dark Side of the Moon* in my purse."

------

Yeah -- *that happened.*
