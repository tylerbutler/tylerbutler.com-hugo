OK, I'm going to keep this short, because I will be writing a lot in the next
month. I am participating in [National Novel Writing Month][1], and will be
writing a 50,000-word fictional novel in the 30 days of November. The journey
will be difficult, but with your prayers I will be victorious. I am
registered at the [NaNoWriMo website][1] as dragonfly2004. Feel free to look
me up. I will be posting my manuscript in its entirety [on this site][2] as I
write it. Hopefully I will also have time to post some stats on how I am
doing, but no guarantees. I'd love for people to read what I write and offer
encouragement during the month, but I'd prefer if there were no comments
regarding the characters, plot, themes, or anything of the sort, because I
want to be able to focus on my vision for the month and not second-guess my
decisions while I am trying to write. Wish me luck.

  
**It's going to be a long month.**
