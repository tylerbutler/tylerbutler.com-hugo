Well, as you can see because you're here, my diary has been moved here to a
blog. The word "blog," for all of you not well-versed in Internet terminology,
is short for Web Log. A Blog is basically an online journal or diary where
people (in this case, mainly me) can post their thoughts, links to cool
things, etc. I started a diary last summer, but I didn't keep it very updated,
and once school started up, I actually forgot all about it. Now summer is here
again, and I am bored out of my mind. I tend to read a lot more now, because I
am so bored, and because of this, I have a lot more things that I want to
respond to. Also, because it is summer, many of my friends are gone, so I have
less people to talk to. So this blog gives me something to do. Also, a blog is
really cool because it allows people to post comments. So if you're a friend
of mine, or even a complete stranger, and you have something you want to say,
post a comment in response to one of my posts! Anyway, that's about it.
