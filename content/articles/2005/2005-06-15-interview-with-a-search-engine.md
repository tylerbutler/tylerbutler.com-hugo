[Dr. Sbaitso][1] was a psychiatrist program that I first played with as part
of my Sound Blaster 16 (my first sound card!) Friends and I actually made some
prank phone calls using it. Hysterical! Anyway, here is a funny article
outlining a "conversation" with the Jeeves search engine of Ask.com. Prepare
to laugh.
