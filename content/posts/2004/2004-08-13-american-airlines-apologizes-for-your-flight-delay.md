When I received an email with the subject "American Airlines Apologizes For
Your Flight Delay," I got a little excited. "Yes! They'll probably offer me a
free flight or some frequent flyer miles or something! Then my hours of
meaningless waiting at the Seattle-Tacoma terminal won't be for nought!" Alas,
it was not to be. Here's the email:

> Dear Tyler Butler,
>
> On two separate occasions during the past week, we experienced technical
difficulties with our computer systems, causing some flights to be delayed. We
understand that you traveled during both periods and likely were doubly
inconvenienced.
>
> Please accept our sincere apologies for any inconvenience you may have
experienced, and rest assured that we are working diligently to take
corrective actions. We greatly value your business, appreciate your
understanding and look forward to delivering the service you deserve in the
near future.
>
> Sincerely,
>
> Dan Garton  
> Executive Vice President Marketing  
> American Airlines
  
I suppose I was dumb to assume that there would be some sort of incentive for
me to continue my association with their airline included in the email, but
there wasn't. As I thought about it more, I realized that flight delays are
just something you have to deal with when you fly, and the fact that I was
expecting to get something out of my suffering was a by-product of a
suffocating atmosphere of "customer-is-always-right" consumerism. So, though I
initially wanted to call them and give them a chance to offer me something, I
decided to keep my mouth shut.

Maybe I did get something after all?
