[Patrick][1] sent me this story. What a cool bear! Does anyone have his
address? I'd like to invite him to my apartment-warming party. Betcha he does
an awesome keg-stand. He's probably been arrested though -- he's well under the
legal drinking age. (Yuk yuk).

> A black bear was found passed out at a campground in Washington state
recently after guzzling down three dozen cans of a local beer, a campground
worker said on Wednesday.

> "We noticed a bear sleeping on the common lawn and wondered what was going on
until we discovered that there were a lot of beer cans lying around," said
Lisa Broxson, a worker at the Baker Lake Resort, 80 miles (129 km) northeast
of Seattle.

> The hard-drinking bear, estimated to be about two years old, broke into
campers' coolers and, using his claws and teeth to open the cans, swilled down
the suds.

> It turns out the bear was a bit of a beer sophisticate. He tried a mass-market
Busch beer, but switched to Rainier Beer, a local ale, and stuck with it for
his drinking binge.

> Wildlife agents chased the bear away, but it returned the next day, said
Broxson.

> They set a trap using as bait some doughnuts, honey and two cans of Rainier
Beer. It worked, and the bear was captured for relocation.
