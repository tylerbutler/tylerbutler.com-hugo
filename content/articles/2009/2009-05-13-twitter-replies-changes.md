There's been some hoopla on Twitter today after a [poorly handled
announcement][1] that the option to control whether replies from people you
follow to people you don't follow show up in your feed. This was an option in
the Notices section of the Twitter settings that was off by default. The
original post from [@biz][2] made it sound like they were trying to reduce
confusion and that it was no big deal. That's a bit naive -- they should have
seen the backlash coming a mile away... Dave Winer has [a good summary][3] of
problems with how they messaged things.

@biz later posted that they had heard the feedback, claiming it was a
scalability problem with the implementation. I initially didn't buy that
argument, but the [description over at ReadWriteWeb][4] clarifies things
somewhat. [This comment][5] over at Winer's post clarifies it further. I think
I understand now, given their architecture, why this would be a beneficial
change for them to make.

But that's not what I'm ultimately writing about. Much of the complaining from
people opposed to the change has been that it makes it harder to meet new
people on Twitter. If you see a reply to someone else from a person you follow
then you might also be interested in following them. OK, fine, I buy that, but
for me, I simply want to see **everything** people I follow say, regardless of
who they say it to. With clients like [Tweetie][6] and [Twitterrific 2.0
(iTunes link)][7] able to browse through conversations effortlessly, I can use
the tweets from my timeline as a jumping-off point to see the whole
conversation which someone I **am** interested in is involved in. My goal is
not to find new people to follow (though that does happen occasionally), but
rather, just to see what interesting things people I follow are saying. I
don't care who they're talking to. It's not like everything [@Lincolnator][8]
says to [@MajorLB][9] is completely uninteresting to me just because I don't
follow her.

[The proposed changes][10] as they stand right now don't solve my complaint.
But it's early; the smart people at Twitter will figure something out, and
hopefully, it'll solve my scenario and world hunger at the same time. One can
hope and dream.

You can see the protests/commentary on Twitter itself by 
[searching for #fixreplies][11]. It's still the top trending search term as of 
this writing.
