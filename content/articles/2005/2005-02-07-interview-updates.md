**1:15 pm PST, Feb. 7, 2005**
I am writing this from the Marriott Courtyard hotel here in Bellevue, WA. It's
probably the nicest hotel I've ever stayed in, and it has decent high-speed
internet service. I left my apartment in Chicago at 4:15 CST, and the flights
(I was routed through Denver on Frontier) went pretty well. I only had 30
minutes between flights in Denver so I was a little worried that I wouldn't
make it, but I ended up having plenty of time.


Picking up the rental car and checking into the hotel was a breeze. It was
nice to hear, "Well, Microsoft has taken care of everything already, Mr.
Butler. Enjoy your stay," as they handed me the paperwork. I could get used to
this. :-)


I went out and grabbed some lunch, and I plan on driving out to Building 19,
where my interview is, later on this afternoon. I am trying to figure out if
it's worth trying to go downtown and do something, but I might just take a
nap. We'll see. I also have to go over my interview notes again. Anyway, more
later.


** 12:06 am CST, Feb. 11, 2005**
Well, I intended to write more, and I still do, but I have been getting quite
a few questions about my status, especially since I promised to put stuff
here, so here goes. I **did** receive an offer from Microsoft, which I am
currently considering. More info will be coming, especially about the
interview itself and how it went/what I did, but for now: I do have an offer.
:-)


**3:43 pm CST, Feb. 14, 2005**
I have officially accepted Microsoft's offer, and am aiming for a start date
of March 28th. I suppose it seems kind of fast, but there are benefits to
getting out there soon. Dr. Sun has accepted the news more gracefully than I
had anticipated, so things are looking up. I will be posting my overview of
the interview day itself in a few minutes.
