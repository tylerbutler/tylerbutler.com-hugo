"Wow," was all I could say after reading this article. For those of you who
are unaware, a MUD is an online multi-user game. (There is a MUD FAQ at
[http://www.mudconnect.com/mudfaq/][1]) Anyway, the game in question is
Achaea, a text-based MUD. It seems that the creators of the game introduced a
highly addictive substance, called "gleam," into the game environment, and
players' characters quickly became addicts. The benefit of using gleam is an
increase in the character's dexterity, but players who are suffering from
withdrawals after becoming addicts and trying to quit are paying a high price:
it can take up to 25 hours of in-game time to recover from gleam addiction.
Maybe people will learn from this virtual experience? Nope, didn't think so...
