I released the next major version of Engineer, version 0.5.0, last month. I didn't quite meet all of my goals with the release (not the least of which was the release date, which was five months later than I had optimistically planned), but it's a major one nonetheless. As usual, full release notes are available at [Read the Docs](https://engineer.readthedocs.org/en/master/changelog.html).

Unfortunately, upgrade may or may not work for you the normal way due to setuptools changes. There are more details in the [upgrade docs](https://engineer.readthedocs.org/en/master/upgrade.html).

Lots of cool stuff in this release, and more planned, so if you've not tried Engineer yet, now might be a good time.
