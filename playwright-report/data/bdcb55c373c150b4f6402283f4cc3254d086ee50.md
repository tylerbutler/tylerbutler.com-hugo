      - text: "When you go to GitHub, I want you to see the latest in-development version. The reason is pretty simple: Since official releases are fairly slow, but I actually make changes fairly often, I want to make sure that activity is shown on the GitHub homepage – via the ‘x days ago’ text that shows up on the far right of the code listing. My hypothesis is that people make some judgements based on the activity level of project.

    - paragraph: Seems to be the natural thing to do, right? If they click the link in Engineer’s README to visit the docs at RTD, then I want them to go to the version of the docs that corresponds to the version they just installed – the most recent released version.
    - paragraph:
      - text: Now this is also relatively easy to do. RTD actually has some smarts around
      - link "multiple versions of documentation":
        - /url: https://docs.readthedocs.org/en/latest/versions.html
      - text: . RTD offers a few different settings that are relevant to my goals.
    - paragraph:
      - text: First, there is a baked in ‘version’ identifier called
      - emphasis: latest
      - text: "which is intended to point to the most recent version of your docs:"
    - blockquote:
      - paragraph:
        - text: In the normal case, the latest version will always point to the most up to date development code. If you develop on a branch that is different than the default for your VCS, you should set the
        - strong: Default Branch
        - text: to that branch.
    - paragraph:
      - text: Of course, in my case, development is done on the
      - emphasis: dev
      - text: branch, so I want
      - emphasis: latest
      - text: to point to that branch. Fortunately that’s easy to change, as the second sentence above alludes to. In the
      - emphasis: Advanced Settings
      - text: section of the RTD dashboard, you’ll find a
      - emphasis: Default branch
      - text: setting, in which I entered

      - text: . Great; now
      - emphasis: latest

    - paragraph:
      - text: The second setting of relevance in RTD is the

      - text: branch, which will always be the most recent released version.

      - text: There is, of course, still a problem. Ideally, I would like links that people follow to go to the version of the documentation that matches the version of the code they’re coming from and vice-versa. In other words, I would like the documentation link from the README file in the

      - text: .
    - paragraph:
      - text: Unfortunately, that’s not really possible. Sure, I could build some intelligent redirector or something that would look at the referrer URL and redirect to the appropriate docs version, but that’s not something I want to build anytime soon. The best I can do is provide some notes in the documentation itself telling people that they
      - emphasis: may
      - text: be looking for a version of documentation that is different from what they’re seeing. It’s not quite ideal from my perspective, but I think it helps.
