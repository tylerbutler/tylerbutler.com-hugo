My site has been going up and down lately. It's not a problem with MOSS or the
server. Both have stayed up and running without any problems. Unfortunately,
the environment that my server is in has been having problems with their
switch. Apparently it's rebooting itself constantly, which is "a common issue
for this brand and model of router." Anyway, no biggie, my site isn't exactly
mission-critical. But weekends are the best time for me to work on
enhancements, and I have a few in mind that I was looking forward to getting
set up. Alas, 'twas not to be. Everything seems to be working now, though, so
hopefully it'll stay this way.
