For some reason I've been the target of telemarketers recently, and I think
I've found the secret to getting them to hang up and stop calling: **just say no
three times.** Three seems to be the magic number. The first two times you say
you're not interested, they continue to pester, but the third time, they thank
you for your time and say goodbye. I have had much more success with this
method than with simply hanging up on them. First, that makes me feel rude,
and a telemarketer is still a person who has a job and there's no reason for
me to be rude to them just because I'm annoyed. But second, and more
importantly, simply hanging up seems to increase the likelihood that the same
people will call me back with the same offer. Saying no three times seems to
reduce that likelihood in my non-scientific experimentation.
