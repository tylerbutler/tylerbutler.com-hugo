It's that time of year again! Both [Steam][] and [GOG][] have holiday sales going on right now, and it's a great time to pick up some great entertainment at a solid discount.

In particular, GOG's "Pick 5 & Pay $10" is a total steal, *especially* if you like adventure games, and the success of Double Fine's [Kickstarter campaign][dfa] says many of you do. [Botanicula][] on its own is worth $10 easily in my opinion, and if you haven't yet played [Machinarium][] you can score them both. There's also [Gemini Rue][], [To the Moon][], the [Blackwell Bundle][], and [Resonance][]. I don't know much about any of them except they're all adventure games.

If adventure games aren't your bag, I can vouch for [Spacechem][] as a *very* solid puzzle game. [Defcon][] also looks interesting though I haven't played it personally. [Anomaly Warzone Earth][] is an engaging twist on tower defense, while [Torchlight][] will bring back many (hopefully good) memories of Diablo and Diablo II.

Honestly, there's not much on the list that wouldn't be a solid choice as far as I know, except possibly [Geneforge][] -- that one looks pretty bad. But hey, maybe I'm wrong! In the end, I wound up going with:

- [Botanicula][]
- [Gemini Rue][]
- [To the Moon][]
- [Symphony][]
- [Unmechanical][]

On the Steam side, there's a ton to choose from, but in particular you can pick up [Limbo][] for less than $3! For the next two hours at least. If you haven't played it, it's required gaming. **Required.**
