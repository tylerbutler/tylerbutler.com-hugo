Seems to be the trend these days to ‘review' the year, and since I am nothing
if not a trend-follower (snicker)… Here goes.

In 2010 I:

  * Got married -- well, we had our official wedding, anyway
  * Shipped Office 2010 and joined a new team at work
  * Started teaching Web Design at Issaquah High School
  * Learned to write apps for Windows Phone 7
  * Moved from Mercer Island to Lynnwood
  * **Almost **downed the Lich King in Icecrown Citadel -- hopefully I'll get him during the guild run on Monday!
  * I bought an iPad
  * Gained weight
  * Grew a beard
  * Learned firsthand the challenges of living near the in-laws

In 2011, I predict the following things will happen:

  * I'll stay married
  * I'll keep shipping software as part of Office
  * I'll prepare to teach another bunch of high school students the awesomeness of Web Design
  * I'll share what I've learned so far from my experience teaching here on tylerbutler.com
  * I'll re-theme/redesign tylerbutler.com
  * I'll lose weight, then gain much of it back
  * I'll shave my beard and vow never to grow it again
  * I'll ship the first of what I hope will be several apps for Windows Phone 7
  * I'll dig in and start hardcore learning HTML 5
  * I'll speak at some conference somewhere
  * I'll buy some new Apple gadget, but probably not a phone
  * I'll build a new computer so I can play WoW on Ultra
  * Elizabeth will start graduate school
  * We'll get either a second car or a second dog
  * I won't take nearly enough vacation
  * I won't play nearly enough video games
  * I won't have nearly enough time to code
