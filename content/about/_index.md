I'm Tyler Butler, a web developer and designer in Mercer Island, Washington, where I live with two insane chihuahuas and a yard that I'm convinced is plotting to take over the world.

I'm the creator of [Engineer][], a static website generator, and [xkcd 2][], an alternative site for viewing
xkcd comics. Most of my recent work is [available on github][github].

I believe that functional things should be pretty and non-functional things should be destroyed. Python is
my language of choice, but I have been known to whore myself out to lesser languages when the need arises.

## Get in Touch

You can reach me at **tyler@tylerbutler.com** or [follow me on Twitter][twitter]. If you haven't heard from me
in awhile, it's because I'm too busy changing the world. After all, somebody has to.
