Everyone repeat after me... **Correlation does not _imply_ causation!** Just
because two things can be proven to correlate does not guarantee a cause and
effect relationship. Here's a funny example from the [Wikipedia article][1] on
the topic (courtesy [The Simpsons][2]):

> **Homer**: Not a bear in sight. The "Bear Patrol" is working like a charm!
>
> **Lisa**: That's specious reasoning, Dad.
>
> **Homer**: [_uncomprehendingly_] Thanks, honey.
>
> **Lisa**: By your logic, I could claim that this rock keeps tigers away.
>
> **Homer**: Hmm. How does it work?
>
> **Lisa**: It doesn't work. (_pause_) It's just a stupid rock!
>
> **Homer**: Uh-huh.
>
> **Lisa**: But I don't see any tigers around, do you?
>
> **Homer**: (_pause_) Lisa, I want to buy your rock.

Please please please stop assuming that determining a cause and effect
relationship is as straightforward as observing a correlation. It's not.

**Note:** I know the `!=` operator is not equivalent to "does not imply." But I am 
too lazy right now to see if there's even a Unicode character for the right symbol.
