How often are you contentedly watching a movie in your comfortably air
conditioned room, when a friend (Matt Cerney, for the record) throws your door
open and yells, "Dude, the projects are on fire!" Welcome to my life. Never
dull, that's for sure. By the time Ricardo and I got out there, it was mostly
just billowing smoke. I still haven't heard exactly what happened, or if there
were fatalities or injuries. Nevertheless, running outside was the most
exercise I'd gotten in awhile, and Matt's expression as he opened the door to
my room almost made the whole experience worth it in and of itself.
