## Overview

ReadyCheck is a [Django][]-based web application designed to make managing raids in
World of Warcraft easier -- and prettier. I got sick of the crappy PHP-based raid managers out there,
so I decided I could do better.

Will be licensed under the MIT license, but source code isn't yet available.
