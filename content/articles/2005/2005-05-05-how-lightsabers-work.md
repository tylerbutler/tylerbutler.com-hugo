As if we needed any more proof that lightsabers are cool, HowStuffWorks.com
has a story explaining [how lightsabers work][1]. It is **hilarious**, and
frighteningly informative, and made my entire day at the office bearable. Here
are some choice quotes from the article:

> ...be sure to handle any active lightsaber with extreme care until you are
completely familiar with its feel and handling.

> By using the Force, the wielder can anticipate the path of the blaster bolt
and align the blade with that path prior to the bolt's arrival. Using normal
visual tracking to accomplish the same effect can be far more difficult.

> The risk of personal injury is much higher with a double-bladed lightsaber,
and their practical applications around the home are limited. Therefore, it is
probably best to save your money and stick with the single-blade version.

> Although a lightsaber is typically used as a defensive weapon by Jedi
knights, the availability of lightsabers on consumer sites such as eBay is
growing. It is a sad fact of life, but if a Jedi knight falls on hard times,
his lightsaber is one source of quick cash. He can always build another one.

> ...many new owners are pleasantly surprised by the many domestic uses of a
lightsaber around the home or office.

  
There are also some excellent pictures with captions.
