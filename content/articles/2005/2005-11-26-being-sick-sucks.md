Guh. I hate being sick. And of course it has to hit me during my four-day
Thanksgiving weekend. To make matters worse, today is the **only** day this
entire weekend that has been sunny. I'll probably force myself to hobble
outside at some point to get some vitamin E, though. You can't waste a day
like this, considering what the weather's been like out here lately.

Anyway, I feel like I've got malaria. I know it isn't (if it was, I'd still be
in bed), but the nausea and fever/chills reminds me too much of it. Oh well,
even if it is, I've survived it before, so I can do it again. The only
thing that would make this suck less is if my mom was here. She would serve me
soup and Sprite until I felt better. Mmmm... Luckily mom and dad'll be
back in the US this Christmas, so maybe I can get sick again while they're
here. Gotta live it up while you can.
