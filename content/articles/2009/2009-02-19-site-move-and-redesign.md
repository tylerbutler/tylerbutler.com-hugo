The server that is currently hosting the SharePoint version of tylerbutler.com
is being decommissioned. Unfortunately, I wasn't given much notice about this
so I have not been able to secure an alternative SharePoint-ready location at
Microsoft to host the site. In the meantime I've used this opportunity to move
the site over to WordPress, and I've refreshed the look and feel. Hopefully
this will be temporary, since I intend to rebuild the site on the new version
of SharePoint once it's publicly available. But in the meantime, WordPress is
serving my needs.

The main www address should be redirecting to blog.tylerbutler.com as soon as
the DNS changes propogate. The main RSS feed should be switched over, but I
have not yet moved the others. Regardless, though, you shouldn't notice any
differences since I'm using FeedBurner.
