A bit cheesy, but glad to see some news about the next version of Office
finally coming out. I wish there were some screenshots or videos in the little
movie clip, but it's early -- I'm sure we'll be releasing that sort of stuff in
the future. It'll be a busy next few months for those of us on the product
group, but it's exciting to finally start telling people about all the cool
stuff we've built.
