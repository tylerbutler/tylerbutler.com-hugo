I came across several different articles regarding a wide variety of topics,
but they all center around Apple's OS, user interface design, and the concept
of cruft. I found them to be quite interesting, and I learned a lot. I think
I'm going to force the IPRO 305 students to read a few of them before they
start redesigning the [HawkTour][1] interface.

  
### [When Good Interfaces Go Crufty][2]

A good introduction to the basic concept of cruft, which, as the article
states, should be familiar to any programmer worth his salt, especially those
involved in UI design. Unfortunately, few programmers, let alone computer
users, realize what sort of cruft they've become accustomed to through regular
computer use.


### [The Art of the Parlay][3]

An interesting discussion of the common belief that Apple could be Microsoft
if they'd made some different decisions in the 80's. An interesting history
lesson, and includes some comparisons of the Apple and Microsoft approach to
product design.


### [In the Beginning was the Command Line][4]

A historical look at BeOS and how that OS was an attempt to attack cruft. Too
bad it failed to become popular (for various reasons).
