Several of my banks have been "upgrading" their security since the beginning
of the year. I have pretty much accepted the fact that "upgrading" security
means my blood pressure will needlessly rise the next time I try to access my
account.

The latest security craze seems to be these security questions. "Mother's
maiden name" apparently doesn't cut it anymore. Security questions drive me
insane, because there's invariably a finite set of options I have to choose
from. _Favorite childhood superhero?_ _Name of firstborn child?_ What is this
crap? **None** of it is easy for me to remember! Why don't you let me pick my
**own** question and my **own** answer? Now I have to remember some "fact"
that I made up as an arbitrary answer to some stupid question that a bank
decided was an excellent way to distinguish me from some sorry thief.

To add insult to injury, many times I have to select** two or more** security
questions. **OMG. [I hate banks so much.][1]**
