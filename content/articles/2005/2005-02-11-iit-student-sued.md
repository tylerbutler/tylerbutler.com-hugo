According to [this story][1] on [Slashdot][2], the maintainers of
ninjahacker.net are currently being sued by Tecmo under the DMCA. This is
pretty ridiculous, in my opinion, but I am anxious to hear how it turns out.
Game hacking has been an interesting (sub)culture, and has provided us with
awesome games, not the least of which is [Counter-Strike][3]. Obviously, there
is probably more to the supposed DMCA "violations," but I daresay it's a
misuse of the law nonetheless. Maybe the [EFF][4] should take a look? Oh, and
by the way... the guy that runs (or ran, since it's now offline) the site
lives in State Street Village and attends IIT. Cool!
