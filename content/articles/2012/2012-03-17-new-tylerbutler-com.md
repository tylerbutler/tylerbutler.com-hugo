I've just pushed out a brand new version of [tylerbutler.com](/). It's a completely original redesign from the ground up, and is built using a static blog engine I wrote called [Engineer][]. I can now write posts in [Markdown][], save them to a folder that gets synced everywhere via [Dropbox][], and reap the speed and huge scale benefits that come with a static site. I'll be posting a bit more about Engineer soon, and the source will be up on GitHub eventually as well.

One of the major goals when rebuilding the site was to encourage me to *write* again. My last post was in January of *last year*, and the last substantial post was long before that. That's just... embarrassing...

I haven't decided whether to migrate any of my old posts over or not. There's frankly not a lot of it that's relevant at this point, and the prospect of making a completely fresh start has quite a bit of appeal. We'll see. Most likely I'll leave them up at some archive site for my own benefit (I learn a lot from periodically going back to old stuff I wrote and reading it again with fresh eyes). The world will weep to lose them, I'm sure.

Anyway, here's hoping I'll be writing more often soon. I have no excuses!
